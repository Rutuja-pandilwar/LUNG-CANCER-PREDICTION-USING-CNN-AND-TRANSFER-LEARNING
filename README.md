# LUNG-CANCER-PREDICTION-USING-CNN-AND-TRANSFER-LEARNING
An automated, AI-driven diagnostic tool for the accurate and rapid classification of lung cancer from CT scan images.

üìù Project Description
Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, making early and accurate detection crucial. This project addresses the challenges of traditional, subjective diagnostic methods by proposing a deep learning solution for automated lung cancer prediction from Computed Tomography (CT) scan images.

The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enhanced with Transfer Learning to classify images into four distinct categories:

Normal

Adenocarcinoma

Large Cell Carcinoma

Squamous Cell Carcinoma 

The final model achieved a high classification accuracy of 93%, demonstrating a robust and efficient alternative for oncological diagnostics that can provide near-instantaneous predictions compared to traditional methods.
